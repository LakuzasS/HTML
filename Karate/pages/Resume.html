<p id = "p2">
The idea of martial sports appeared very early in my family because my father 
working in the penitentiary services and in the justice system absolutely wanted 
to transmit to me and my brother the basics of combat.
</p>
<p id = "p2">
After doing 2 years of Judo, I wanted to do a sport that allows me to defend myself
against any type of person. So I did some research and then I started karate 8 years
ago now. I immediately fell in love with this sport because it requires a lot of 
attention, observation, cardio, muscular endurance and above all technique, which 
is more suited to my physique than to Judo.
</p>
<p id = "p2">
I started with 2 years in the course for children then directly in the course for 
adults for 6 years. The age difference doesn't matter so much to me anymore and I 
even prefer to work with someone stronger because you immediately get used to not 
making mistakes, otherwise you take the hits.
</p>
<p id = "p2">
This sport has made me gain enormously in self-confidence and helps me enormously to 
analyze the behavior of people and to identify their faults and their strengths.
</p>
<p id = "p2">
Goju-Ryu offers very important breathing Katas for mastering your body that are 
difficult to understand for beginners because they are very technical, but which 
allow strong concentration and good stress regulation.
</p>
<p id = "p2">
Being very few at the club, this gives us the advantage of progressing quickly. I 
have the chance to be able to work the entire Katas with my sensei which is not 
normally possible given my experience. This then allows me to deepen the technics 
in detail and expand my panel of attacks / defenses during fights.
</p>
<p id = "p2">
Currently, I wanna pass my black belt but it will only be possible in June when 
passing grade which gives me time to prepare myself well before.
</p>

<article id = "Kobudo">
<article id = "p3">Kobudo</article>
<p id = "p2">
I have always been a fan of Bruce Lee and the idea of ​practicing nunchaku was a 
childhood dream for me. 
</p>
<p id = "p2">
Fortunately, I came across the right club because indeed we are the only one in Alsace 
to practice authentic Okinawa Kobudo. At first I watched the teachers do it because it 
is forbidden to practice it under 16 years old given the dangerousness and the responsibility.
</p>
<p id = "p2">
However, we cheated a bit because, being serious and my father was taking part in the course,
we had the authorization to practice with my brother for 4 years. Since then, we look forward
to each session. Note that they are counting on us to become the Kobudo Alsace referents. 
</p>
<p id = "p2">
Weapon practice gives a feeling of power that requires good self-control before even starting
the weapon. The founders said that arms were like an extension of the body. It is by doing 
and applying that we develop these high-precision reflexes.
</p>
<p id = "p2">
The practice of weapon is different in Europe than in Japan. Indeed, we should not wait
5 years per weapon, we can immediately make several even if it is not recommended at the 
start.
</p>
<p id = "p2">
For the moment I master the fundamentals and advanced katas of the first 4 weapons 
which are: The Bô, the Tonfa, the Saï, and the Nunchaku. I also have some notions of 
Kama but in wood because the real ones do not come under my level (>4th dan).
</p>
<p id = "p2">
Depending on the country, there are Kobudo belts. In the case of France, it is
the same as in karate. It's funny to see black belts being lost in training and to 
teach them and correct them.

<p id = "p2">
Every year, sensei Ohsiro organizes courses in Alsace in our three clubs
neighbors of Goju-Ryu. It's a moment that we appreciate, during which we exchange between clubs
and where the sensei can correct us. Being based in Clamart (92) and in Paris, it is difficult
to attend often.
</p>
<p id = "p2">
I've been there twice and the atmosphere is great, the people are super friendly
and for someone motivated, we learn a lot in a few days, we compare our techniques,
skirmishes with experts while making friends.
</p>
<p id = "p2">
For 3 years, during the summer holidays we all met in Bourges and Vichy in sports CREPS
in order to stay motivated because of covid. We did super intense one-week courses with 6 
hours of practice a day, but as said, when one loves, one does not count.
</p>
<p id = "p2">
It was in a huge stadium with more than 100 people including almost than high-ranking 
karateka. It was super rewarding, and on top of that, cryotherapy sessions, and
Leisure activities were available to us.
</p>
<p id = "p2">
I also participated in other courses, in other styles of Karate which always serve more 
for knowledge but also in self-defense, Krav-maga and Nihon taï Jitsu with prison staff 
and militaries.
